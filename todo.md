## v1.0 planning follow-ups
- [x] Create milestone issues M6-M8 and link them from ROADMAP.
- [x] Capture v1.0 requirements in docs/PRD-v1.0.md.
- [x] Draft interface freeze + compatibility matrix (M6).
- [x] Define benchmark dataset/generator and baseline metrics (M7).
- [ ] Publish release readiness checklist + v1.0 release notes (M8).

## Doc fixes from user feedback (2026-02-02)
- [x] README: correct "All commands support --json" (init lacks --json).
- [x] README: CLI synopsis should list --json for `recall add` and `recall rm`.
- [x] README: audit references to missing docs/scripts (DESIGN.md, WORKFLOWS.md, ROADMAP.md, docs/*, ./x) and fix links or packaging.
- [x] README: make snapshot token workflow reproducible (show `stats.snapshot` capture and `--snapshot` usage).
- [x] README: clarify single-file store claim vs config/lock file presence.
