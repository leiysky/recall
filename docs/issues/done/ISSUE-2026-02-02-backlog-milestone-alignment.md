# ISSUE-2026-02-02-backlog-milestone-alignment

Status: done
Milestone: Milestone 0 — Workflow Hygiene
Owner:
Created: 2026-02-02
Updated: 2026-02-02

Context:
Backlog issues use shorthand milestone labels (M1–M6) that no longer align with
ROADMAP.md, which now names milestones explicitly. Aligning them makes the
backlog status quo easier to scan and keeps issue metadata consistent.

Scope:
- Update open and active issue milestone fields to match ROADMAP.md.
- Refresh Updated dates for edited issues.
- Record this hygiene task in ROADMAP.md and the daily progress log.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Open and active issues list milestone names that match ROADMAP.md.
- ROADMAP.md references this backlog hygiene issue.
- Progress log links this issue and notes the alignment work.

Out of Scope:
- Reprioritizing milestones or changing ROADMAP ordering.
- Editing done issues.

Notes:
- Documentation-only metadata alignment.
